      ## <%= Conf.id.name %> Service Terms and Conditions

      __Date of Last Revision: March 3, 2017__

      The use of services provided by <%= Conf.id.legal_name %> (hereafter referred to as “<%= Conf.id.name %>”) constitutes agreement to these terms. In the absence of any other prevailing document, the provisions of this document shall serve as a binding contract between <%= Conf.id.name %> and you.

      <p class="notice">BY ENROLLING IN, ACTIVATING, USING, OR PAYING FOR <%= Conf.id.name.upcase %> SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND FULLY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>

      ### E911 Service

      <%= Conf.id.name %> provides you with phone services over your broadband connection. There is an important difference between the <%= Conf.id.name %> service and the phone service provided over a traditional phone line — this difference is that the E911 dialing feature with <%= Conf.id.name %> has important limitations that you should be aware of and that you advise others that may use the <%= Conf.id.name %> service in your residence or business.

      YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REGISTERING THE E911 DIALING FEATURE BY TAKING AFFIRMATIVE STEPS TO LOG INTO YOUR ACCOUNT PORTAL TO PROVIDE AND/OR VERIFY A VALID PHYSICAL ADDRESS. IF YOU MOVE THE LOCATION OF WHERE YOU USE THE <%= Conf.id.name.upcase %> SERVICE, YOU MUST AFFIRMATIVELY REGISTER THE E911 DIALING FEATURE AT THAT LOCATION BY CHANGING THE ADDRESS. IF YOU FAIL TO CONFIGURE YOUR LOCATION OR CHANGE THE ADDRESS TO A NEW LOCATION, THE E911 DIALING FEATURE WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY AND POTENTIALLY NO EMERGENCY SERVICE WILL BE SENT TO YOUR LOCATION.

      Additional limitations are as follows:

      If you lose power or there is a disruption to power at the location where <%= Conf.id.name %> is used, neither <%= Conf.id.name %> nor the E911 dial feature will function until power is restored. You should also be aware that after a power failure or disruption, you may need to reset or reconfigure the <%= Conf.id.name %> devices prior to utilizing the service, including the E911 dialing feature.

      If your Internet connection or Broadband Service is lost, suspended, terminated or disrupted, neither <%= Conf.id.name %> nor the E911 dial feature will function until the Internet connection or Broadband Service is restored.

      If your <%= Conf.id.name %> account is suspended or terminated, the <%= Conf.id.name %> service outage will prevent the E911 dialing feature from functioning. There may be a greater possibility of network congestion and/or reduced speed in the routing of E911 dialed calls utilizing <%= Conf.id.name %> as compared to traditional 911 dialing over traditional public telephone networks.

      You are responsible for the accuracy and the completeness of the address that you submit to <%= Conf.id.name %> for the location at which <%= Conf.id.name %> will be used and to which emergency service will be sent in the event that you use the <%= Conf.id.name %> E911 dialing service. You are responsible for updating and of the advising us of any and all changes to the address or location at which <%= Conf.id.name %> will be used. <%= Conf.id.name %> uses a third party to route the E911 dialed calls to the applicable local emergency response center or to the national emergency calling centers. We make no warranties or guarantees as to whether, or the manner in which, E911 dialed calls that you make are answered or responded to by the local emergency response center or by the national emergency calling centers. We disclaim any and all liability or responsibility in the event that the third party data used to route E911 dialed calls is incorrect or yields an erroneous result. Neither <%= Conf.id.name %>, its officers, directors, stockholders, parent corporation, its affiliated or subsidiary corporations, employees, representatives or agents may be held liable for any claim, damage or loss, and you hereby waive any and all such claims or causes of action, arising from or relating to <%= Conf.id.name %> E911 dialing service unless such claims or causes of action arise from <%= Conf.id.name %>’s gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct. You agree to release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless <%= Conf.id.name %>, its officers, directors, stockholders, parent corporation, its affiliated or subsidiary corporations, employees, representatives or agents and any other service provider who furnishes services to you from any and all claims, damages, losses, suits or actions, fines, penalties, cost and expenses (including, but not limited to, attorney fees) or any liability whatsoever, whether suffered, made, instituted or asserted by you or by any other party or person, for any personal injury to or death of any person or persons, or for any loss, damage or destruction of any property, whether owned by you or others, or for any infringement or invasion or the right of privacy of any person or persons, caused or claimed to have been caused, directly or indirectly, by the operation, failure or outage of services, incorrect routing, or use of, or inability of a person to use, <%= Conf.id.name %> 911 dialing feature or service or access emergency service personnel.

      ### Equipment

      You are not authorized, nor may you allow any other person, to update the firmware, load third-party firmware, or otherwise tamper with <%= Conf.id.name %> supplied devices, nor are you authorized to connect any devices not supplied by <%= Conf.id.name %> without prior written authorization from <%= Conf.id.name %>. Service credits will NOT be issued for the time the service is down due to tampering or unauthorized configuration of devices. If you or your agents attempt to circumvent this restriction, <%= Conf.id.name %> may immediately terminate your service. <%= Conf.id.name %> reserves the right to remotely access and manage any devices connected to our network.

      ### Service Limitations

      Due to the nature of VoIP services, <%= Conf.id.name %> service is not designed to be used for data connections with modems, home security systems, credit card processors, postal meters and related devices. It is optimized for voice only and you may experience issues and inconsistencies when using <%= Conf.id.name %> service in non-voice scenarios.

      ### Services Average Use Only

      <%= Conf.id.name %> unmetered residential and small business VoIP plans are intended for general business use only. Any other use is strictly prohibited. <%= Conf.id.name %> uses automated systems to monitor usage to detect patterns which are typical of extraordinary use such as telemarketing, call center, autodialing, continuous call forwarding, frequent, excessively long calls to single numbers, etc. Cloud PBX plans are designed for users with average usage of 2,500 minutes per month. Accounts exceeding 2,500 minutes per month per user on a regular basis are subject to review. If an account exceeds 2,500 minutes per user in a calendar month, <%= Conf.id.name %> may require that additional users be added to the account. <%= Conf.id.name %> shall have sole discretion to determine whether usage is consistent with average usage or not.

      ### Invoicing

      <%= Conf.id.name %> services are billed monthly on the first day of each month. The monthly Invoice includes the following items:

      - Monthly Recurring Charges (e.g. CloudPBX licenses, DID charges, SIPTrunks) for the upcoming month
      - Pro-rated Monthly Recurring Charges for any new Services added during the prior month
      - Non-recurring Charges (e.g. setup fees, number porting fees, etc.) incurred during the prior month
      - Usage Charges (e.g. international calls, toll free charges, etc.) incurred during the prior month
      - Applicable Federal, State and Local Taxes for all Services

      ### Payments and Late Fees

      If you provide credit card information to <%= Conf.id.name %>, You authorize <%= Conf.id.name %> to charge such credit card for all Charges listed on your Invoice. It is your responsibility to provide <%= Conf.id.name %> with credit card information that is current and valid. If <%= Conf.id.name %> has agreed to accept payment by a method other than a credit card, invoiced Charges are due net 10 days from the invoice date. If any invoiced amount is not received by <%= Conf.id.name %> by the due date, then without limiting our rights or remedies, those Charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower. You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to <%= Conf.id.name %> and notifying <%= Conf.id.name %> of any changes to such information.

      ### Disputes

      All amounts must be paid in full by the Invoice Due Date unless Customer elects to withhold a good faith disputed amount. If Customer, in good faith, disputes the amount or appropriateness of any Charge, the Customer must notify <%= Conf.id.name %>, in writing, of the disputed Charge upon withholding a disputed amount, but in any event, no later than thirty (30) days of the invoiced date indicated on the disputed invoice. Failure to contest an invoice within thirty (30) days of the invoiced date will create an irrefutable presumption of the correctness of the Charge, absent manifest error, and Customer shall have waived its right to dispute that Invoice. In the event of a billing dispute, the Customer may withhold payment of such disputed amounts pending the resolution of the dispute, provided that the Customer shall not withhold payment of more than 5% of the total invoice amount absent manifest error in said invoice. If more than 5% of the total invoice is withheld in dispute, <%= Conf.id.name %> reserves the right to suspend all Services until dispute is resolved. Disputed amounts notwithstanding, all undisputed amounts must be paid in full by the Due Date of the invoice.

      ### Suspension of Service

      If any amount owed by you under this or any other agreement for <%= Conf.id.name %> services is 30 or more days overdue, <%= Conf.id.name %> may, without limiting our other rights and remedies, suspend services until such amounts are paid in full. We will give you at least 5 working days’ prior notice that your account is overdue before suspending services to you.

      ### Cancellation

      <%= Conf.id.name %> requires thirty (30) days written notice in order to cancel an account. The 30 day written notice period will begin at the time of receipt of this notice by <%= Conf.id.name %>, unless otherwise specified in this policy. If Customer account is “past due” at time of the cancellation request, Customer will be immediately responsible for the amount due in order to begin the process of account cancellation and start the 30 day notice period. All accounts must complete one billing cycle after the cancellation request is made, before the account can be closed. The Customer will be responsible for and agrees to pay the Service and Usage Charges billed during the final billing cycle. The account will be officially closed when final payment is received.

      ### Right to Refuse or Terminate Service

      <%= Conf.id.name %> reserves the right to refuse to provide service to anyone at its sole discretion with or without reason. <%= Conf.id.name %> also reserves the right to terminate accounts with or without reason at its sole discretion. If <%= Conf.id.name %> terminates service for any reason other than a material breach of this agreement or any other agreement between you and <%= Conf.id.name %>, you will receive a pro rata refund for any prepaid service. If <%= Conf.id.name %> terminates service for material breach of this agreement by you, you are not entitled to any refund. You may terminate service at any time by written notice to <%= Conf.id.name %>. If you terminate service for any reason other than a material breach of this agreement by <%= Conf.id.name %>, you forfeit any prepaid fees paid by you.
